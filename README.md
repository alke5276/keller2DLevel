# Level Design Exercise - Design Goals

My levels design goals were primarily focused on player choices as well as player accuracy. For the choices, I had the idea of having th eplayer either decide to figh the spitting enemies or the attacking ones through two different paths, both leadint to the same destination. I was able to make this with a valley of the attacking enemies and a floating pllatform with the spitting enemy. Later, the player must also choose to break down a wall in the knowledge that he/she will be attacked by enemies. However in order to complete the level the player must do this. So while this is a choice, the player is encouraged to fight the enemy. 
As far as accuracy, the player must strategically jump from one single squared platform to the next. This challenegs the player to quickly manuever trhough the air to land directly on the platform. 
There is also the challenge of an enemy spitting at the player from a moving platform. This was just an overall challenge to the player to have them try to use the moving pllatform and jump to the next cube without getting hit by the enemy. 

# Peer Feedback 

"I thought that your game had a good evolution of difficulty as you progressed through the level. At the start, the player was presented with a choice to face two common monsters or one scarier projectile monster. Then as you progress through the level, it becomes a platforming challenge, where the projectile monsters are even more of a threat. I liked the final boss room where you could see the end, but you knew you had to face your fears and fight the final monster. I think if this level was extended to add more mini-puzzles throughout, it would be more of an extended challenge."

In analyzing my peer review and from watching Perry play my game, the first initial choice option for the player was a success. Later it was seen as a transition from choice to accuracy of play. When I myslef played through the level, I didn't use the height of my last vertical moving platform to jump over the final monster (the one the character is supposed to break walls down to fight). However, when watching someone else play my game, Perry certainly did, and he was able to then jump over the entirety of the final monster, not having to break down any walls. I ended up altering the end of my game by adding more breakable walls so that the player has to fight the monster before exiting the level. 

I think the most challenging part of the level from mmy watching was where the spitting enemy hidden within the flooring. Here Perry often would get shot by the enemy thinking he was out of range or blocked by the land blocks (he was not). Amidst jumping he would often get shot midair and then topple past the accuracy needed section. 

Overall, I agreee with Perry's review. I think giviing the player more choices as mini-puzzles would definately make the level more challenging, as well as more fun when the 'puzzles' are solved.
